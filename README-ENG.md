# Introduction

In this repository, you will find the projects I have developed in Java that I consider interesting.

# Projects

## SQL Query Application

This is an application developed using MVC that allows you to perform SQL queries on a database (INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE). It distinguishes between two types of users: client and administrator. Client users are only allowed to perform SELECT queries, while administrators can perform all types of queries.
